# ðŸ”ƒ PolySync

The PolySync utility can be used to sync your local Forge mods with the Polygondwanaland server.

It can also download the version of [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) the server is using and the [Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/).

## Usage

### Sync

After opening the application, click **Sync** to sync your local Forge mods with the server's.

Any mods that you have installed that aren't on the server will be placed in a `backup` directory within your Minecraft `mods` directory.

This behavior can be disabled by checking **Keep Existing** before clicking **Sync**.

You can also force the utility to overwrite existing mods by checking **Force**.

### Mods

You can open your Minecraft `mods` directory in your Operating System's file explorer by clicking **Mods**.

### Download Forge Installer

Clicking **Download Forge Installer** will download the installer to your `Desktop` for the same version of Forge the server is using.

After downloaded, you can install Forge by running the downloaded `forge-installer.jar` file on your `Desktop`.

Select **Install client**, click **OK**, then **OK** again once complete.

**NOTE: Java and the Minecraft Launcher is required in order to run the Forge installer.**
